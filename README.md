Description: Final Lab for Fundamentals of Computing 2

This code was written for the final assignment of my Fundamentals course. The report.txt file explains functionality in more detail, but the code is intended to calculate the Jaccard Similarity of two text files (given as command line arguments). The program is designed to work with plain text files and can parse HTML files, filtering tags except "a href=". The project was intended to emulate functionality needed for something like a web-crawler. Again, the report goes into a little more detail.
